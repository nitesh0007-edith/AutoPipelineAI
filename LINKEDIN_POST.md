## 🚀 Excited to Share: AutoPipelineAI v0.3.0 - Open Source LLM-Driven Agentic Framework!

I'm thrilled to announce the release of AutoPipelineAI v0.3.0 - a comprehensive, **100% local and private** framework that brings the power of Large Language Models and autonomous agents to data workflows!

### 🎯 What is AutoPipelineAI?

It's an open-source framework that transforms how we handle data pipelines by combining:
- 🤖 **Multi-Agent Orchestration** (ETL, Query, and Profiling agents)
- 🧠 **Natural Language Interface** (Ask questions in plain English!)
- 📄 **Document Intelligence** (PDF extraction with NER)
- 🗄️ **High-Performance Analytics** (DuckDB integration)
- 🔒 **Complete Privacy** (Everything runs locally - no cloud dependencies!)

### ✨ Key Highlights

**🎮 5 Operational Modes:**
1. **Manual Mode** - Traditional ETL with smart filters
2. **LLM Mode** - "Show me top 10 products by sales" → Instant results!
3. **Agent Mode** - Describe workflows in English, agents handle the rest
4. **PDF Mode** - Extract tables, text, and entities from documents
5. **Database Mode** - SQL analytics with DuckDB speed

**📊 Technical Deep Dive:**
- Built with Python 3.10+, Streamlit, LangChain, and CrewAI
- Integrated with Ollama for local LLM execution (llama3, mistral, phi3)
- spaCy for Named Entity Recognition
- Safe code execution sandbox for security
- Comprehensive caching layer for performance
- 100+ unit tests for reliability

### 🎨 What Makes It Special?

**For Data Engineers:**
- Autonomous ETL pipeline orchestration
- Multi-source data integration
- Schema validation and data profiling
- Export to CSV, Parquet, SQL databases

**For Data Analysts:**
- Ask questions in natural language
- Automated data quality checks
- Interactive visualizations
- PDF report processing

**For Developers:**

### 🚀 Why I Built This

As a Data Engineer at IQVIA, I've seen firsthand how time-consuming manual data workflows can be. I wanted to create a solution that:
- Democratizes access to LLM-powered automation
- Maintains data privacy (100% local execution)
- Reduces repetitive ETL tasks
- Makes data analysis accessible through natural language
- Remains completely open-source and extensible

### 🎓 What I Learned

Building this taught me invaluable lessons about:
- Multi-agent system design and orchestration
- Safe LLM code execution patterns
- Balancing flexibility with safety in AI systems
- Creating intuitive interfaces for complex workflows
- The power of local-first AI applications
